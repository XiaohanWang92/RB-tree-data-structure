# RB-tree-data-structure
A event counter backed by balanced search tree Red Black Tree

This is a small course project.
We were required to implement a event counter data structure using Red Black Tree. For more detailed information, please check the 'request' directory.

In order to run the code on Linux, first of all you can use 'make' command to compile the source code. To follow the requirement, I redirect system standard in/out, you can run the code with command like:

 java bbst test_1000.txt < commands_1.txt > output_1.txt

Here test_100.txt is the input parameter, commands_1.txt is the input command (std in is redirected to this file) and std out is redirected to a file called output_1.txt.

There is still a tricky bug need to be fixed, I am still working on this.
